# product_recommender
Built a recommendation engine using user-based collaborative filtering. The system analyzes user-product rating data, calculates user similarity with cosine similarity, and recommends products not yet rated by the user. Developed using Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn) and visualized product trends with Matplotlib.
