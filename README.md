Product Recommendation System

This project implements a simple Product Recommendation System using collaborative filtering based on user-product ratings. The system suggests products to users by analyzing similarities in preferences across different users.

Objective

To recommend products to users based on the ratings given by similar users, using cosine similarity for collaborative filtering.

Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

10 ratings by 5 users

3 products: Bag, Shoes, and Watch

Each user rated one or more products

Key Features

Creates a User-Product matrix

Computes cosine similarity between users

Recommends new products that similar users liked

Visualizes average product ratings using bar charts

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

scikit-learn (cosine similarity)

Matplotlib (for bar chart visualization)

Google Colab

Sample Output

User-Product Matrix

User Similarity Matrix

Recommendation list for a selected user

Bar chart showing average product ratings

Future Improvements

Use larger datasets with real-world data

Switch to item-based collaborative filtering

Include product categories and timestamps

Deploy the system as a web application using Flask or React
